## Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that represents the layout and structure of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app. It focuses on the placement of elements and user flow without emphasizing design details like colors or images.

## Importance of Wireframing

- Provides a clear blueprint for designers and developers.
- Helps identify usability issues early in the process.
- Saves time and resources by streamlining design revisions.
- Facilitates collaboration and communication within teams.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

### 1. Layout Structure

Defines the overall arrangement of the page, including headers, sidebars, and footers.  
_Example: A grid-based layout ensures consistency and balance across all pages._

### 2. Navigation

Shows how users move through the interface via menus, links, or buttons.  
_Example: A top navigation bar helps users quickly find main sections like Home, About, or Contact._

### 3. Content Placement

Indicates where text, images, and multimedia elements will appear.  
_Example: Placing a hero image at the top draws immediate attention to key information._

### 4. Functionality

Represents interactive components such as buttons, forms, and search bars.  
_Example: A login form wireframe ensures the design supports essential user actions._
